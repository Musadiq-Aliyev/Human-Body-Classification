# Human-Body-Classification
## Dataset contains 1500 CT scans of various parts of the body such as abdomen, chest and head. 
1. Constructed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture from scratch to extract features from the images. 
2. Applied the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF)  algorithms to the extracted features from CNN.
